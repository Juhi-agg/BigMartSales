The base dataset was taken from the Analytics Vidya Hackathon. <br>
<b>Objective: </b>To predict the sales of Big Mart
<b>Data Provided: </b>Product Specifications and Outlet Specifications including categorical and numerical features.

Step 1: Understanding the data <br>
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
Step 3: Data Cleaning <br>
Step 4: Model building and testing <br>
Step 5: Repeatition from Step 3 <br>

<b> <h2>Major Takeaway </h2></b> 
  Though it seems Data Cleaning is just a small part and modeling is the part of project which requires the utmost attention, is it not so. Modeling is a significant role player in the project but Data cleaning is even more important. Dropping columns for ease and for avoiding to clean them is NOT a good idea at all.
